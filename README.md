### Problem formulation
The data consists of units of work (e.g. people-days, PT) assigned to each employee in each project. We can represent this as a matrix of size #employees-by-#projects, which includes all employees and all projects (values will be 0 for employees not working in a project). We'll call this the EP matrix for short.

Two user-triggered operations are supported:

* Sliding: the user changes the value of one employee's PT in one project (i.e. an element in the EP matrix) by using the range slider. As a consequence, other values of the matrix should be automatically adjusted to accommodate the change.
* Optimizing: the EP matrix is recalculated from scratch to satisfy an optimality criterion, defined by the user (e.g. minimize total costs). This is a one-shot operation performed by the user with a button click.

All operations obey the following constraints:

* EP matrix values must be non-negative: 0 where the employee is not working the project, and strictly >0 where the employee is working in the project.
* Both marginal totals of the matrix are fixed. This enforces the constraint that employees have a set capacity, and that a project requires a set amount of work. To change the totals, the user must change the original dataset.

Below are the implementation details of the two methods.

#### Sliding
When the user sets the PT value for an employee in a given project, the other values should be changed to compensate accordingly, while keeping fixed employee and project marginal totals.

In this scenario, the following elements of the matrix are _constants_: the user-supplied value, and the zero-values of employees not working in a project. All other _n_ elements are our actual variables, which define an _n_-dimensional space of solutions.

Given _I_ employees and _J_ projects, we can describe the variables and their constraints as a linear system of _n_ equations, such as:

```
x(e1,p1) + x(e1,p2) + ... + x(e1,pJ) = sum(x(e1,:))	_# marginal total for employee 1_

x(e1,p1) + x(e2,p1) + ... + x(eI,p1) = sum(x(:,p1))	_# marginal total for project 1_

...
```

We can then express the linear system in matrix form (_Ax = b_), and find x by solving the matrix. However, because the problem is under-determined (there is no unique solution to the matrix), we must define a criterion for choosing a solution. The simplest criterion is just to minimize the deviation from the "exact" solution _Ax = b_.

This effectively becomes a *linear least-squares problem* with bounds on the variables:

```
minimize L2 norm of (Ax - b), subject to:

x >= PT_MIN
```

where:

* _A_ selects the employee totals and project totals that should be fixed.
* _b_ is the vector of totals selected in A.
* _x >= PT_MIN_ means that employees who are in a project cannot be assigned fewer than that amount of PTs (e.g. 1). To remove the employee from the project (set the value to zero), the user must manually delete them.
* Note that, because the user-supplied value is a constant (and is therefore not included as a variable in the least-squares formulation), it is subtracted from the marginal totals _b_.
* Solver used: `scipy.optimize.lsq_linear`


#### Optimizing
In this scenario, the following values are _constants_: the user-supplied value, and the zero-values of employees who do not have the skills for a particular project. Importantly, the optimizer _may_ add employees to new projects to which they were originally not assigned, or remove employees from projects they were originally working in -- provided that the skills match.

The problem is formulated as a *linear program* with equality and inequality constraints. The objective function to be minimized is, for example, the total cost of employees.

```
minimize F(x) = Cx, subject to:

Ax = b,

x >= 0
```

where:

* C is the vector of costs (â‚¬/work unit) for each (employee,project) combination in _x_.
* A is the design matrix for employee and project marginal totals (set as equality constraints).
* b is the RHS for the equality constraint.
* Solver used: `cvxopt.solvers.lp`
